So I created the Driver enrolment function as a substitute for you automatically moving drivers between competitions because I didn’t know this wasn’t this was a feature now that I know this is something that you can do what I would like to do is create a competition that sort of acts a tear competition basically so the idea is so that every every Driver in the league has something to play for we’re going to rank drivers by tears from SABNC there will be four drivers in each year and every three races you’ll have the opportunity to move if you are at the bottom of your tear you’ll be relegated to the table below and if you are at the top of your tea you’ll be promoted to the tear above now what I would like is a function that every three races these changes are automatically implemented so that I don’t have to do it manually and that way we won’t need the Driver enrolment function however there are a bunch of functions are cascading from the enrolment function so why wouldn’t need to do is completely remove the Driver enrolment function and any functions are that are cascading from that so for example you can now see you’re attending any race you can check into races because you’ll be enrolled in every race and says no longer a Driver in Roman function remove the ability from admin to enroll and un enroll drivers from certain races. Remove all of the notifications that are tied to enrolment. This is basically deleting them from the code base because then not needed and then implement functions for the tear for the third competition so if a driver is promoted or relegated, they would need a notification in green for promotion and a notification in red for relegation. They should be able to check into all races like I mentioned before and I think that’s everything if you can also do a sweep and let me know what functions need to be removed another word removing the Driver enrolment function and let me know what functions need to be added based off what I’ve told you.
