I need to modify the Tiered Championship logic in my go-karting league app.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT refactor the entire codebase
- Do NOT use autonomous agent mode
- Only update the specific logic required
- Make changes incrementally and explain before editing files

Current behaviour:
- Tiered Championship points are mirrored directly from the Individual Championship results.

Problem:
- This creates unfair point gaps when a lower-tier racer finishes very high overall in a race.

New required behaviour (this replaces the old logic):

Tiered Championship Scoring Rules:
- Tiered Championship points are calculated independently from Individual Championship points.
- Within each tier, racers can earn a maximum of 4 points per race.
- Points allocation within a tier:
  - 1st in tier = 4 points
  - 2nd in tier = 3 points
  - 3rd in tier = 2 points
  - Last in tier = 1 point

How placement within a tier is determined:
- Use the finishing positions from the Individual Championship race.
- For each race:
  1. Group racers by their current tier (S, A, B, C).
  2. Within each tier, sort racers by their individual race finishing position (lower is better).
  3. Assign tiered points based on their position relative only to others in the same tier.

Example:
- C-tier racers finish the race in positions: 1st, 5th, 9th, 11th overall.
- Within C-tier:
  - 1st overall → 1st in C-tier → 4 points
  - 5th overall → 2nd in C-tier → 3 points
  - 9th overall → 3rd in C-tier → 2 points
  - 11th overall → last in C-tier → 1 point

Additional requirements:
- Individual Championship points remain unchanged.
- Tiered Championship points are stored separately.
- This logic must run automatically after each race result is saved.
- No manual intervention required.

Points reset rule (important):
- After every tier shuffle, Tiered Championship points for all racers reset to zero.
- Only Tiered Championship points reset.
- Individual Championship points are never reset and continue accumulating.

Rank/tier changes and point resets take effect immediately after the shuffle is completed.

Start by:
1) Identifying where tiered points are currently calculated
2) Proposing the minimal logic change needed
3) Updating only the necessary functions or services
4) Explaining the change clearly before applying it
