We want to build a cross-platform mobile and web app for managing and tracking go-karting leagues, competitions, and individual races. The goal is to provide organisers, racers, teams, and fans with a powerful, flexible tool to input results, track performance, and customise league rules. The core experience should be intuitive, data-rich, and highly customisable.

Core Features

⸻

✅ 1. User Accounts & Roles
	•	User types: Admin/Organiser, Racer, Team Manager, Spectator
	•	Authentication via email, social login, and phone number
	•	Permissions based on role (e.g., only Admins can edit rules, create competitions)

⸻

✅ 2. League & Competition Management

Admins should be able to:
	•	Create multiple Leagues (e.g., “Spring Championship”, “Amateur Cup”, “Head-to-Head Series”)
	•	Define season dates, locations, and formats per league
	•	Create multiple Competitions within a league:
	•	Series Championship
	•	Head-to-Head
	•	Time Attack
	•	Knockout brackets
	•	One-off races / Time trials

Customisation options per competition:
	•	Points allocation rules

	•	Pole position = +3
	•	Most passed positions = +2
	•	Scoring curves (e.g., exponential, linear, custom)
